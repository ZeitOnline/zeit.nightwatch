pytest helpers for http smoke tests


Making HTTP requests
====================

``zeit.nightwatch.Browser`` wraps a `requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ ``Session`` to provide some convenience features:

- Instantiate with a base url, and then only use paths:
  ``http = Browser('https://example.com'); http.get('/foo')``
  will request https://example.com/foo
- A convenience ``http`` fixture is provided, which can be configured via the ``nightwatch_config`` fixture.
- Use call instead of get, because it's just that *little bit* shorter.
  (``http('/foo')`` instead of ``http.get('/foo')``)
- Fill and submit forms, powered by `mechanicalsoup <https://pypi.org/project/MechanicalSoup/>`_.
  (We've customized this a bit, so that responses are only parsed with beautifulsoup if a feature like forms or links is actually used.)
- Logs request and response headers, so pytest prints these on test failures, to help debugging.
- Use ``sso_login(username, password)`` to log into https://meine.zeit.de.
- See source code for specific API details.


Example usage::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def nightwatch_config():
        return dict(browser=dict(
            baseurl='https://example.com',
            sso_url='https://meine.zeit.de/anmelden',
        ))

    def test_my_site(http):
        r = http.get('/something')
        assert r.status_code == 200

    def test_login(http):
        http('/login')
        http.select_form()
        http.form['username'] = 'joe@example.com'
        http.form['password'] = 'secret'
        r = http.submit()
        assert '/home' in r.url

    def test_meinezeit_redirects_to_konto_after_login(http):
        r = http.sso_login('joe@example.com', 'secret')
        assert r.url == 'https://www.zeit.de/konto'


Examining HTML responses
========================

nightwatch adds two helper methods to the ``requests.Response`` object:

* ``xpath()``: parses the response with ``lxml.html`` and then calls ``xpath()`` on that document
* ``css()``: converts the selector to xpath using `cssselect <https://pypi.org/project/cssselect/>`_ and then calls ``xpath()``


Example usage::

    def test_error_page_contains_home_link(http):
        r = http('/nonexistent')
        assert r.status_code == 404
        assert r.css('a.home')


Controlling a browser with Selenium
===================================

``zeit.nightwatch.WebDriverChrome`` inherits from ``selenium.webdriver.Chrome`` to provide some convenience features:

- Instantiate with a base url, and then only use paths:
  ``browser = WebDriverChrome('https://example.com'); browser.get('/foo')``
- A convenience ``selenium`` fixture is provided, which can be configured via the ``nightwatch_config`` fixture.
- ``wait()`` wraps ``WebDriverWait`` and converts ``TimeoutException` into an ``AssertionError``
- Use ``sso_login(username, password)`` to log into https://meine.zeit.de
- See source code for specific API details.

nightwatch also declares a pytest commandline option ``--selenium-visible`` to help toggling headless mode,
and adds a ``selenium`` mark to all tests that use a ``selenium`` fixture, so you can (de)select them with ``pytest -m selenium`` (or ``-m 'not selenium'``).
Since you'll probably want to set a base url, you have to provide this fixture yourself.


Example usage::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def nightwatch_config():
        return dict(selenium=dict(
            baseurl='https://example.com',
        ))

    def test_js_based_video_player(selenium):
        from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
        from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
        s = selenium
        s.get('/my-video')
        s.wait(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, 'videoplayer')))


Advanced usecase: To intercept/modify browser requests with `selenium-wire <https://pypi.org/project/selenium-wire/>`_, install that package (e.g. ``pip install selenium-wire``) and set ``driver_class=ProxiedWebDriverChrome`` in the nightwatch ``selenium`` config::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def nightwatch_config():
        return dict(selenium=dict(
            baseurl='https://example.com',
            driver_class='ProxiedWebDriverChrome',
        ))

    def test_inject_authorization_header(selenium):
        s = selenium
        s.request_interceptor = lambda x: r.headers['authorization'] = 'Bearer MYTOKEN'
        s.get('/protected-page')


Controlling a browser with playwright
=====================================

As an alternative to Selenium (above) nightwatch also supports playwright;
mostly by pulling in the ``pytest-playwright`` plugin, so you can use their fixtures, with some convenience features:

- Configure a base url, and then only use paths:
  ``page.goto('/foo')``

Example usage::

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def nightwatch_config():
        return dict(selenium=dict(
            baseurl='https://example.com',
        ))

    def test_playwright_works(page):
        page.goto('/something')


Running against different environments
======================================

To help with running the same tests against e.g. a staging and production environment, nightwatch declares a pytest commandline option ``--nightwatch-environment``.

A pattern we found helpful is using a fixture to provide environment-specific settings, like this::

    CONFIG_STAGING = {
        'base_url': 'https://staging.example.com',
        'username': 'staging_user',
        'password': 'secret',
    }

    CONFIG_PRODUCTION = {
        'base_url': 'https://www.example.com',
        'username': 'production_user',
        'password': 'secret2',
    }

    @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
    def nightwatch_config(nightwatch_environment):
        config = globals()['CONFIG_%s' % nightwatch_environment.upper()]
        return dict(environment=nightwatch_environment, browser=config)

    def test_some_integration_that_has_no_staging(http, nightwatch_config):
        if nightwatch_config['environment'] != 'production':
            pytest.skip('The xyz integration has no staging')
        r = http('/trigger-xyz')
        assert r.json()['message'] == 'OK'


Sending test results to prometheus
==================================

Like the medieval night watch people who made the rounds checking that doors were locked,
our use case for this library is continuous black box high-level tests that check that main functional areas of our systems are working.

For this purpose, we want to integrate the test results with our monitoring system, which is based on `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io>`_.
We've taken inspiration from the `pytest-prometheus <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-prometheus/>`_ plugin, and tweaked it a little to use a stable metric name, so we can write a generic alerting rule.

This uses the configured `Pushgateway <https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/>`_ to record metrics like this (the ``environment`` label is populated from ``--nightwatch-environment``, see above)::

    nightwatch_check{test="test_error_page_contains_home_link",environment="staging",job="website"}=1  # pass=1, fail=0

Clients should set the job name, e.g. like this::

    def pytest_configure(config):
        config.option.prometheus_job_name = 'website'

This functionality is disabled by default, nightwatch declares a pytest commandline option ``--prometheus`` which has to be present to enable pushing the metrics.
There also are commandline options to override the pushgateway url etc., please see the source code for those details.
